## Project Description
A Java application for managing people and their dogs.  
The application allows creating `Person` and `Dog` objects with specific attributes and provides methods to interact with these objects.

## Project Structure
The application consists of three main classes:
- `Dog.java`: Represents a dog with attributes like name and age.
- `Person.java`: Represents a person who may own a dog.
- `MainApplication.java`: Demonstrates the functionality of `Person` and `Dog` classes.

Additionally, two test classes ensure the correctness of the application:
- `PersonTest.java`: Unit tests for `Person` class.
- `DogTest.java`: Unit tests for `Dog` class.

## Features and Methods Implemented
- Creating `Dog` objects with name and age.
- Creating `Person` objects with or without a dog.
- Checking if a person has an old dog (10 years or older).
- Changing a dog's name.
- Exception handling for dog-related operations.
